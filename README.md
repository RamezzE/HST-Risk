## Overview

HST Risk is a cross-platform React Native mobile application, built for a non profit organization called HST ( Helio Sports Team ).

The app is inspired by RISK, the known board game, but with a spin. How it works:

- Each team starts with a set number of countries, while competing other teams for other countries.
- Each team registers attacks on other teams through the app, but they have to complete real life challenges for the result to be registered in the app by an admin.
- When the result is set, the team conquers the opponent's country, reflecting in real time on the app's map.
- The app features attack timers, income by minute, custom money adding (for other challenges), real time updates, push notifications for attacks by/on your team and more.

Tech stack used: 
- React Native
- Expo
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Socket.io
